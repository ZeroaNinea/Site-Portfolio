# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Angular 20**.  
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean, animated, and responsive design.

## ✨ Features

- **Hero section** with 3D animations.
- **About Me** section with smooth transitions.
- **Tech Stack** section using drag-and-drop with Angular Material.
- **Projects** section with animated 3D cubes, random background lighting, and links to live/demo projects.
- **Contacts** section with GitHub and Gmail links.
- Section-based **theme switching** (unique color scheme for each section).
- **Responsive design** for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

```bash
ng serve
