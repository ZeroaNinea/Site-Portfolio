  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="typewriter">
    I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong background in
    building modern, scalable applications. Using Angular, Node.js, and
    cloud-native tools like Docker and Kubernetes, I create performant and
    reliable solutions that meet both technical and business needs. My expertise
    spans from frontend development with Angular and RxJS to backend APIs with
    Express and Nest.js. With experience in testing, CI/CD pipelines, and
    performance optimization, I deliver clean, maintainable code that brings
    ideas to life. Whether it's crafting interactive UIs or deploying resilient
    services, I aim to turn complex problems into simple, elegant solutions.
